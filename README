BRAT - Broadview Radar Altimetry Toolbox README
== == == == == == == == == == == == == == == == == == == == == =



Overview
== == == ==

The Broadview Radar Altimetry Toolbox (BRAT) is a collection of
tools and tutorial documents designed to facilitate the processing
of radar altimetry data. BRAT is able to handle most distributed
radar altimetry data formats, providing support for ingesting,
processing, editing (to a certain extent), generating statistics,
visualising and exporting the results.

A full user manual for BRAT is available in the file
brat_user_manual.pdf in the 'doc' directory of the BRAT
distribution or installation.The user manual contains all the
necessary information about installing and running BRAT.

This README file contains the version history for BRAT, a list of
known issues, and any other last - minute added or updated
information that can not( yet ) be found in the user manual.In
the case of conflicting information, this README file is
authoritative.



Known Issues
============

- Window Buttons in Gnome Desktop

The software recognizes Gnome when when running in a Linux desktop 
and sets the appropriate properties for the minimize, maximize and 
close buttons to be displayed in view windows. However, in Debian 8 
it was verified that additonal configuration steps might be necessary, 
at the system level, for those buttons to be dislayed. 

This issue, which affects not only BRAT but other GUI applications
as well, can be solved by running 

gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences button-layout appmenu:minimize,maximize,close

and by calling gnome-tweak-tool from the command line and then 
selecting "Windows", "Titlebar Buttons", and clicking "ON" for the 
maximize and minimize buttons.


- Spurious error messages about map projections

The first time a view is displayed in a BRAT GUI session, it is 
possible that messages like

"ERROR 6: EPSG PCS/GCS code 54003 not found in EPSG support files."
"Is this a valid EPSG coordinate system?”

are printed to the console. These messages are not issued by BRAT
itself and the reasons why they originate have no consequences on
BRAT functionality. They can be safely disregarded.


- Troubleshooting BRAT startup issues caused by OpenGL check failures

By default, when the BRAT GUI application starts, some tests are executed 
to evaluate the system's OpenGL capabilities. The user can then be alerted 
if some 3D views (3D plots or the globe) have limitations or are not 
displayed at all. In some systems, the Qt framework is not always able to 
recover from these test failures, and the application crashes without 
being able to circumvent the error and/or display any warnings to the user. 
If BRAT cannot start, this is the most common reason, namely in virtual 
machines. To disable these default checks, and allow BRAT to start 
nevertheless, please see the BRAT Software User Manual, section “3.7. 
Troubleshooting OpenGL issues”.

Known problems with the V4.0.0-beta release:
- Contours:
	Contours are only available for spectrograms (by selecting "Contour" options inside "Data Options" tab of
	the generated View). In the full release it will also be available for the Maps and Globe views type.
- Vector Plots:
	Vector plots are currently not supported and will be implemented for the full release.
- Log Scale:
	Logarithmic scale is currently not supported and will be implemented for the full release.
- Colour Table:
	Currently it is not possible to select a custom colour table, and for this reason, for both type of plots,
	spectrogram and map, a default colour table is used. To be implemented for the full release a set of
	predefined colour tables.
- Sampling and Filter:
	Sampling is the equivalent for the old "Set resolution and filter" feature. Currently this is not customizable
	and each time a plot of the type z=f(x,y) is computed, default values are used for the maximum and
	minimum of latitude (90 and -90 degrees respectively), maximum and minimum (180 and -180 degrees
	respectively) of longitude and a step of 1/3 degrees in each axis. Setting of the parameters to be
	implemented for full release.
- Scheduler:
	Scheduler feature allows to postpone one or more operations, however this is not implemented yet, and
	will be available for full release.
- Saving plot results in an image file:
	This feature would allow the user to save the Plot results in an image file (such as JPEG, PNG or TIFF),
	however was not implemented, and will be available for full release.
- Aliases:
	Aliases are short names or unified names for data fields. There are NetCDF files read by Brat that do not
	have pre-defined aliases. This will implemented for the full release.
- Export Operation:
	This option allows the user to export the current operation data to different formats (such as ASCII,
	NetCDF and GeoTIFF). This feature will be for the full release.
- Show Info Button:
	Provides information about the original units (the ones defined in the data products) and the units used
	during computation or selection. This feature is not available yet and will be implemented for full release.
- Faulty Map Projection: Nearest sided perspective:
	This projection is currently not working properly.

    - The call to the geostrophic velocity algorithms is modified to use the
    aliases for longitude and latitude, to make things simpler for users.
    - Updated CODA to version 2.3.1.
    - Internal (CODA) product type names for ERS product types have been aligned
    with ESA naming convention (OPR_pass_file -> ALT.OPR, WAP -> ALT.WAP)
    - Updated CryoSat product format (codadef) to be in line with upcoming
    L1 PFS v4.9 and L2 PFS v2.8. Main changes impacting BRAT are:

  - Bugs fixed :
    * The Loess filters computation were not applied if input files were netCDF
      files.
    * Fixed problem where incorrect lines were drawn for worldmap plots on
      Windows due to rounding issues near the projection boundaries.
    * Fixed issue where a 'marque' (box with dotted lines) could appear in a
      worldmap plot.
    * Included MSVC 2010 DLLs to BRAT IDL and MATLAB directories on Windows to
      prevent usage problems of these interfaces.

  - It is now possible to drag & drop files into the Dataset panel.
  - Several improvements to BratDisplay:
    * the center/zoom functionality for worldplots has been greatly improved.
    * the number of latitude/longitude grid lines will now increase/decrease
      depending on the zoom level.
    * latitude/longitude grid lines now come with a text label showing the
      associated latitude/longitude value of the parallel/meridian.

    * Wrong SSH formula for Topex product (SSH_TOPEX) (since BRAT 2.0.0):
      'Topex dual-frequency ionospheric (Iono_Cor) correction' should be used
      instead of 'Ionospheric correction from DORIS (Iono_Dor).
    * When executing an operation within Brat GUI, expression was sometimes
      reset if it contained a syntax error.
    * For Topex products, the date in Brat output was wrong if the Brat
      operation contained "high resolution" fields (data).

2.1.0 - March 2010
------------------
  - Updated RA2 product format specifications (codadef) to bring them in line 
    with the new Vol14 4/C product format specifications document.
