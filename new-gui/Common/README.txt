This directory was created for all new (v4) development of common modules, while
the main modules tree was evolving. So, it contains interfaces/components that are 
also common to non-GUI software. These ones should now begin to be moved to the
Common sub-directory of the source tree, only a few files at a time, in the scope 
other tasks, to avoid huge and error prone source code location changes. When this
is finished, this file should be deleted.
